# Array Methods Showcase

A collection of vanilla JS demos for array methods like `map`, `filter`, and more.

## Mini-Demos
- Located in `/mini-demos/`.
- Examples: Filtering missions, mapping astronaut names.

## Creative Project
- **Space Mission Tracker**: A retro dashboard using all 8 methods.
- See `/space-mission-tracker`.

## How to Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run format` (Prettier)
3. Open `creative-project/index.html` in a browser.

## What I Learned
- `filter`, `forEach` and `find` are surprisingly complicated when you want to inject them into the DOM
- `map` is a beastmode method, you can make and inject lists directly into the DOM
- `reduce` is great for summing large quantities
